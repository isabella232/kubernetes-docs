Welcome to Intel's Kubernetes Documentation Site!
====================================================
Intel has been committed to furthering open cloud innovation to support data-centric, edge-distributed workloads of the future and provide greater computing performance, speed, security, storage, networking and more. Our early contributions to Kubernetes helped extend capabilities by shaping the architecture and requirements for device plugins, address limitations for a variety of high-bandwidth, low-latency workloads, such as CPU pinning and node feature discovery, and enable new features for use in networking applications such as multiple network interfaces and single root I/O virtualization.

Today, we’re continuing to collaborate across the Kubernetes community and ecosystem to deliver best-fit performance and security for cloud native workloads, ease the developer experience and pave the way for tomorrow.

In this site, you will find detailed documentation and technical guides of each project that we support.
